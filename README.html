<h2>Hello there.</h2>
Welcome to my web page templates. I am hosting these on GitHub for a while as it's easy to show people the amount<br />
of files in a template, and also because my computer has been rather bad for losing things lately. If you see any<br />
errors just go ahead and fix them, I'm storing this on a USB too. I might also include a few Bootstrap templates<br />
too, all sites like GitHub, Twitter, YouTube and Google use it nowadays.
